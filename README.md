# Computer-VIsion---Cardiac-Detection


We will train a model for cardiac detection based on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge).

At first we download the data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data), by clicking on "Download All" and extract it afterwards.
